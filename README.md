# Loan Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with R. The project was created for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

Access the final report here: https://sbsousa.github.io/LoanEDA

## Project Description:

Per Udacity, the goal of this project is to "use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies". 10-15 variables should be explored.

I selected the Prosper Loans data set from the list of available choices. The data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan. 

## Approach

The EDA was conducted in R-Studio using multiple R packages such as knitr, diplyr, and ggplot2. The R Markdown file is included as well as the final knitted report in HTML format.
